# Capstone_project
This capstone Project was done on life insurance cost prediction 
## Project Title:
#### Life insurance cost prediction
 The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using data that provide the optimum insurance cost for an individual. 
 The analysis deals with the prediction of the best insurance cost based on the health and habit-related parameters given in the data.
 Finally, to find the optimal model and contributing variables impacting the target variable, perform EDA and predictive model analysis using a variety of models.
 
## Dataset:
Healthcare Data.csv
## Skills & Tools Covered
#### Cluster Analysis
#### Decision Trees
#### Linear Programming
#### Python
#### Random Forest
#### XGBoost 
#### Ensemble methods

## Conclusion:
After ran all the models on this data, To conclude finally, Random forest regressor basic model holds best for predicting product insurance cost. 
We have found variables years of insurance with us, visited_doctor_last_1_year, age, Year_last_admitted, weight, weight_change_in_last_one_year and covered_by_any_other_company_Y variables are most influential independent variables for predicting insurance cost.
So we can fit a random forest model in to the training set using only these 7 variables and predict the optimum insurance cost.
